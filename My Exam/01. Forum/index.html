                        but
                        great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.</p>

                <p> Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual
                    accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain
                    uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effort—that is what makes a team work, a company
                    work, a society work, a civilisation work.</p>
